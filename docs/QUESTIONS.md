## Q2 · F3's "one event every 3–4 s of in-play time" contradicts its own other numbers  [ticket: F3]  [blocking: no]

**What I need to know:** Which reading of the event-rate criterion you meant. The F3 brief asks for all three of: ~1,800 events, one every 3–4 seconds of in-play time, and 55–65 in-play minutes of a 90-minute match. They cannot all hold: 1,800 events over ~60 in-play minutes is one every ~2 s, and one every 3–4 s over 55–65 in-play minutes is only 825–1,300 events.

**Why I cannot decide it:** it is a criterion in the ticket, and reconciling it is a judgement about the data volume everything downstream calibrates against (CLAUDE.md: any cut or change to a criterion).

**Options as I see them:**
- A: Read "3–4 s" as elapsed match time (~96 min / 1,800 = ~3.2 s). Keeps the 1,800 and the 55–65 in-play minutes. Costs nothing, but the in-play rate is really ~2 s.
- B: Hold the in-play rate at 3–4 s. Gives ~900–1,200 events, which fails "~1,800" and thins the denominators the verifier recomputes from.

**What I did, so you can reverse it:** A. The generated matches land at ~1,800–1,900 events, ~56–60 in-play minutes and ~3.2 s per event over elapsed match time. `test_one_event_every_three_to_four_seconds_of_match_time` encodes this reading.

## Q3 · F4's "a 90-minute match replays in under 4 minutes at 20x" is arithmetically impossible  [ticket: F4]  [blocking: no]

**What I need to know:** Which way to settle the speed criterion. 90 minutes at 20x is 4.5 minutes, and a generated match runs about 95 minutes of clock, so ~4.75 minutes. "Under 4 minutes" needs at least 22.5x, or 24x for our matches. The story the ticket cites (J1) says "a full match viewable in under five minutes", which 20x does meet.

**Why I cannot decide it:** it is an acceptance criterion in the ticket, and changing or dropping one is not mine to do (CLAUDE.md: any cut, including dropping a criterion).

**Options as I see them:**
- A: Change the criterion to "under 5 minutes at 20x", matching J1. Nothing else changes.
- B: Keep "under 4 minutes" and make the fast speed 25x (the replay takes any multiplier). The ticket lists 1x, 5x and 20x as the speeds, so this changes that list instead.
- C: Keep 20x and compress stopped time. That changes what a viewer sees, so it needs its own decision and I would not do it quietly.

**What I did, so you can reverse it:** nothing to the replay, which takes any speed. `test_a_full_match_is_viewable_in_under_five_minutes_at_20x` asserts J1 and passes. The literal criterion is `test_a_match_replays_in_under_four_minutes_at_20x`, marked `xfail(strict=True)` so it stays visible and flips to a failure the moment the numbers change. Remove that marker once you pick.

**Answer:** B. Kehinde: keep "under 4 minutes" and make the fast speed 25x. Done in F4: `FAST_SPEED = 25.0` in `replay.py`, the criterion test runs at that speed, and the xfail marker is gone.
 B
